# Upgrade from v1.10.x to v1.11.0

In this release we introduced support for containerd, and updated the version of the AWS provider to v17.

Upgrading from the previous version requires running the following commands for both the `vpc-and-vpn` and `eks` modules:

1. `terraform init -upgrade`
2. `terraform plan`
3. `terraform apply -refresh-only`

The expected changes when upgrading are:

1. `terraform plan` sees some external changes because of [the `tags_all` introduced in 3.38.0](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/guides/resource-tagging#propagating-tags-to-all-resources) that allows setting tags at the provider level and will be inherited by all the rest and other new attributes that weren't managed by terraform before.
2. [The private endpoint security group rule has been renamed to allow the use of CIDR blocks and Security Groups as source](https://github.com/terraform-aws-modules/terraform-aws-eks/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#v1700---2021-05-28). The existing security group rule will be destroyed and an equivalent one will be created.
3. launch templates get a new attribute "version" changed in place.
