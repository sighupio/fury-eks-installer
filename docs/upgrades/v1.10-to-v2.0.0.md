# Upgrade from v1.10.x to v2.0.0

In version 2.0.0 of `fury-eks-installer`, we split the vpc-and-vpn module in two, to allow the creation of a VPC and VPN separately, as the latter became optional with the introduction of public aws clusters.
We also added the possibility to configure the ability to access the api endpoint privately, publicly or both.

## Migrate from the old vpc-and-vpn module to the new vpc and vpn modules
