# Upgrade from v2.0.x to v3.0.x

In version 3.0 of `fury-eks-installer` we upgraded the aws provider from v3.x to v4.x

> ⛔️ **IMPORTANT**
> we strongly recommend reading the whole guide before starting the upgrade process to identify possible blockers.

## Public clusters

Public clusters usually rely on the `vpc` and `eks` modules, so the upgrade process is pretty straightforward:


```sh
# update the provider and the modules
terraform init -upgrade

# apply the few changes brought in by the update vpc module
terraform apply
```

## Private Clusters

Private clusters are slightly more involved as they are using the `vpn` module.
This requires some extra step for upgrading the buckets configuration due to changes in the provider.

```sh
# update the provider and the modules
terraform init -upgrade

# check out the changes, take note of the bucket name
terraform plan

# run the needed imports, as from the v4 of the module some of the bucket configs were moved to standalone resources
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_versioning.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"

# apply the few changes brought in by the update vpc module
terraform apply
```

## Single modules

Should you have a custom setup and you want to upgrade a single module, you can do so by running the following commands.

### VPC Module

```sh
# update the provider and the modules
terraform init -upgrade

# apply the changes brought by the new versions
terraform apply
```

### VPN Module

```sh
# update the provider and the modules
terraform init -upgrade

# check out the changes, take note of the bucket name
terraform plan

# run the needed imports, as from the v4 of the module some of the bucket configs were moved to standalone resources
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"
terraform import module.vpn.aws_s3_bucket_versioning.furyagent "${BUCKET_NAME}"

# check out no changes are left to be applied
terraform plan
```

### EKS module

```sh
# update the provider and the modules
terraform init -upgrade

# check out no changes are left to be applied
terraform plan
```
